# Differentially Private Fair Learning

http://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/jagielski19a/jagielski19a.pdf

They have recently been a flurry of research on fairness in machine learning, given the concerns of discrimination in machine learning algorithms. 2 demands have been formulated by supra national organizations:

- Demand for non-discriminatory algorithms and models on the one hand
- Restriction on the collection or use of protected attributes on the other

Difficulty resides in the absence, due to privacy, of the sensitive feature.



State of the art:

**Secure multiparty computation (MPC)**: The company works with another party holding consumers' race data: They achieve to produce a fair model, without leaking the races information to the company. However, the authors want to build a model without using race data, even if provided in a secure way.



**Equalized Odds**
