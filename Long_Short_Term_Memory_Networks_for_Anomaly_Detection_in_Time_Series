In this publication, the authors show that for a problem of detection of anomalies in time series, a network of the type Long Short Term Memory offers better results than statistical methods or classical neural networks. The method used here is to use time series without anomalies as input to the network, and as output the new value at step t + 1 of the time series. Once this has been done, the authors seek to choose a threshold beyond which the difference between the prediction made and the value obtained means that there is an error. They note that on time series without time dependencies, the results are as good as those of a classical neural network. On the other hand, when a time dependence is observed, the results of the LSTM network are better on the order of 18 to 30%.
