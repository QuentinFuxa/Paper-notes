# Differentially Private Fair Learning

http://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/jagielski19a/jagielski19a.pdf

There has been a recent wave of research into fairness in machine learning, given concerns about discrimination in machine learning algorithms. 2 requests were made by supranational organizations:

- Request for algorithms and non-discriminatory models on the one hand
- Restriction on the collection or use of protected attributes on the other

The difficulty lies in the absence, due to intimacy, of the sensitive element.



State of the art:

**Secure multiparty computation (MPC)**: The company works with another party holding consumers' race data: They achieve to produce a fair model, without leaking the races information to the company. However, the authors want to build a model without using race data, even if provided in a secure way.



**Equalized Odds**
